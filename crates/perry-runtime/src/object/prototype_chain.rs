//! Observable `[[Prototype]]` side-table for ordinary heap objects (#2820).
//!
//! Perry bakes class IDs at allocation time, so it cannot rewrite an object's
//! baked prototype chain. But `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)` on an
//! *ordinary* object (a `{}` literal, an `Object.create(...)` result, etc.)
//! must be observable: a later `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` returns the same
//! `proto`, and an inherited property read (`obj.x` where `x` lives on `proto`)
//! walks to it.
//!
//! We model this with a thread-local map from the object's heap pointer to the
//! NaN-box bits of its recorded prototype. `proto_bits` for an explicit
//! `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, null)` is `TAG_NULL`, so a recorded-null entry
//! is distinguishable from "no entry recorded" (default prototype).
//!
//! GC correctness: the recorded prototype is a live reference. The map is
//! visited by `visit_object_static_prototype_slot_mut` (wired into the Object
//! rewrite descriptor in `gc/layout.rs`) so a moving collector rewrites the
//! stored bits, and `object_static_prototype_owner_moved` migrates the entry
//! when the *owner* object itself is evacuated.
