//! First-call runtime diagnostic for no-op stubs (issue #464).
//!
//! Some FFI symbols in perry-runtime are intentional no-ops — for the
//! harmonyos build the entire `perry_ui_*` / `perry_system_*` /
//! `perry_updater_*` surface is auto-generated as zero-returning stubs
//! by `build.rs` (issue #395 / #399), and the runtime-only build has
//! a handful of `js_ws_*` / `js_readline_*` stubs in `stdlib_stubs.rs`
//! for the case where `perry-stdlib` isn't linked.
//!
//! Without a signal these stubs reproduce the exact DX cliff #455
//! describes: the program runs, produces wrong output, no warning. So
//! every stub funnels through [`perry_stub_warn`] which prints a
//! single `[perry] warning: ...` line to stderr the first time each
//! symbol is invoked. Subsequent calls stay silent so a hot-loop
//! doesn't flood the terminal.
//!
//! ## `PERRY_STUB_DIAG` env var
//!
//! - unset / `auto` / `default` — first call per symbol prints once.
//! - `off` / `0` / `false` / `silent` — silenced entirely.
//! - `verbose` / `all` — every call prints (debugging aid).
//!
//! The mode is read once on first warning and cached.
