//! JavaScript closure invocation across the FFI boundary (added
//! in v0.5.x of the perry-ffi v0.5 surface — non-breaking; pure
//! additions).
//!
//! Many wrappers need to call back into TypeScript-side
//! functions:
//!
//! - `db.transaction(fn)` (better-sqlite3) — wrap user code in
//!   BEGIN/COMMIT;
//! - `events.on('change', listener)` (events) — invoke listeners
//!   with an event object;
//! - `commander.action(fn)` (CLI) — fire the user's command
//!   handler;
//! - `ws.on('message', cb)` (websockets) — push payloads up;
//! - `cron.schedule(expr, fn)` — invoke the cron handler;
//! - `backOff(fn, options)` (exponential-backoff) — retry the
//!   user's async call.
//!
//! All of these consume a `*const ClosureHeader` (the runtime's
//! closure layout) and call it via `js_closure_call0` /
//! `js_closure_call1` / etc. — perry-runtime exports those as
//! `extern "C"` already, so perry-ffi just declares them and
//! exposes a typed [`JsClosure`] wrapper.
//!
//! # Argument / return ABI
//!
//! Closures cross the FFI boundary as raw f64 values — Perry's
//! NaN-boxing means a single 64-bit register can carry any JS
//! value. Wrapper authors construct arguments via [`crate::JsValue`]
//! and decode return values the same way.
//!
//! # Capture access
//!
//! When wrappers need to construct a *new* closure that captures
//! state (e.g. db.transaction's BEGIN/COMMIT wrapper), they use
//! [`alloc_closure_with_captures`] + the per-slot setters. See
//! the better-sqlite3 wrapper's transaction support for a
//! reference example (added under #466 Phase 5 followup).
